The data on its own is not enough to understand what the data are about and how they were generated.

To make the data understandable, re-usable and, in principle, reproducible, it is crucial to provide metadata --- or data about the data --- including the experimental steps followed to produce the data, the characteristics of the samples, the protocols applied, the transformations applied and so on.

On the other hand, creating the metadata can be time-consuming. So, it is important to provide sufficient information to understand en enable re-use of the dataset, but at the same time striking a balance between the depth and breadth of the metadata provided.
